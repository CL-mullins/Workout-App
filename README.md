Creating a workout app for my Back End Web 1.2 Final Project

This back end project allows a user to create exercise routines

First, the user creates a new exercise within the exercise tab. There a various options to choose from the two choices of 'Body Part' and 'Category'. In further versions, I will add a function that allows the user to complete individual workout models that have different input forms based on the category selected.
Example: A 'reps only' workout will only have the option for the user to input their repititions of the exercise, while omitting weight added.

Secondly, the user can create a routine that is composed of many exercises. These routines will be the building block for the 'routines' that were specified in the previous section.

As of deployment, the link should be live at https://cm-workout-app.herokuapp.com/ with the features that have been described above. The user must log in to the app to access it.

In the future, I plan on adding the exercise feature as well as more flair to the UI on the front end as well.
